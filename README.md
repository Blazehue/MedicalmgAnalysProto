**Q: Can I contribute if I'm also learning?**  
A: Absolutely! This project welcomes learners. Share your ideas, report bugs, or suggest improvements.

**Q: Will you add machine learning models?**  
A: Yes! That's the next major goal. Working on integrating CNN-based detection as I learn deep learning.

**Q: Can this handle 3D MRI volumes?**  
A: Currently limited to 2D slices. 3D volumetric processing is on the roadmap.
