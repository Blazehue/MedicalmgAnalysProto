# Medical Image Analysis Tool

## Project Overview

This project creates a medical image analysis tool for X-ray and MRI preprocessing with abnormality detection using contour analysis and statistical reporting capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- Medical image preprocessing and enhancement
- Automated abnormality detection using contour analysis
- Statistical reporting and visualization
- Support for DICOM and standard image formats
- User-friendly GUI interface

## About This Project

This tool was created as a **learning prototype** to explore and understand the fundamentals of image processing and computer vision techniques. As someone learning image processing, I developed this project to:

- Gain hands-on experience with OpenCV and medical image processing
- Understand contour detection, image enhancement, and filtering techniques
- Explore the challenges of working with medical imaging data
- Build a foundation for more advanced machine learning approaches

### Important Notes

⚠️ **This is a prototype tool and is NOT accurate for real medical analysis**

- The abnormality detection uses basic contour analysis and thresholding techniques
- Results are highly experimental and should NOT be relied upon for any medical decisions
- The tool lacks the sophisticated algorithms and training required for accurate medical diagnosis
- This is purely an educational project to understand image processing concepts

### Future Development

This project is actively being developed and improved:

- **Planned Enhancements:**
  - Integration of larger and more diverse medical imaging datasets
  - Implementation of machine learning models (CNN-based detection)
  - Training on labeled medical image datasets (e.g., ChestX-ray14, BraTS)
  - Improved preprocessing pipelines specific to different imaging modalities
  - Feature extraction and classification algorithms
  - Validation against ground truth medical annotations

- **Learning Goals:**
  - Transition from basic contour analysis to deep learning approaches
  - Understand medical image segmentation techniques
  - Explore transfer learning with pre-trained medical imaging models
  - Implement proper validation and evaluation metrics

## Installation

- Preprocess X-ray and MRI images
- Detect abnormalities (nodules, fractures, brain anomalies)
- Generate comprehensive PDF reports
- View statistical analysis and visualizations

## Current Limitations

As a learning project, this tool has several limitations:

1. **Detection Accuracy**: Uses basic contour detection which produces many false positives/negatives
2. **Limited Dataset**: Trained/tested on minimal reference data
3. **No Ground Truth Validation**: Results haven't been validated against medical annotations
4. **Simplified Preprocessing**: Basic enhancement techniques that may not suit all image types
5. **No Clinical Validation**: Has not undergone any clinical testing or validation

## Hardware Requirements
- Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for large medical images)
- Graphics card with OpenCV GPU support (optional but recommended)

## Contributing

As this is a learning project, contributions and suggestions are welcome! If you have experience with medical imaging or image processing, feel free to:
- Suggest improvements to the detection algorithms

## Educational Resources

This project was built while learning from:
- OpenCV documentation and tutorials
- Medical image processing papers and courses
- Computer vision fundamentals
- Open-source medical imaging projects

## Disclaimer

**CRITICAL: This tool is NOT intended for medical use**

- This analysis is for research and educational purposes only
- Results should NEVER be used for medical diagnosis without professional review
- The tool is a learning prototype with NO clinical accuracy guarantees
- Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical imaging interpretation
- The creator assumes NO responsibility for any misuse of this tool

This is a student/learning project to understand image processing techniques, not a medical device or diagnostic tool.
