The Medical Image Analysis Tool follows strict data privacy and security principles:

- **Local Processing**: All image processing occurs locally on the user's machine
- **No Data Transmission**: Medical images are never transmitted to external servers
- **Temporary Storage**: Intermediate files are stored temporarily and cleaned up after processing
- **User Control**: Users maintain complete control over their data at all times
- **No Data Collection**: The application does not collect or store any user data

### Security Measures

- **File Access Control**: The application only accesses files explicitly selected by the user
- **Read-Only Operations**: Image files are opened in read-only mode to prevent accidental modification
- **Secure Output**: Generated reports and data are saved only to user-specified directories
- **No Network Dependencies**: The application functions completely offline after installation
- **Dependency Verification**: All third-party libraries are from trusted sources

### Compliance Considerations

While this is a research tool and not a medical device, it is designed with healthcare data sensitivity in mind:

- **HIPAA Considerations**: Designed to minimize exposure of protected health information
- **GDPR Alignment**: Follows principles of data minimization and user control
- **No Analytics**: No usage analytics or telemetry data collection
- **Transparent Processing**: All processing steps are visible to the user
